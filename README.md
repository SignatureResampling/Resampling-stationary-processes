# Resampling Stationary Stochastic Processes Based on A Single Path

We study the problems of resampling stochastic processes based on a single path observation. A new covariance-based dissimilarity measure is introduced, from which the stationary process of quite similar patterns can be re-generated. As a valuable application, we resample fractional Brownian motions and provide a new and more powerful method to estimate the Hurst parameter of fractional Brownian motion.
